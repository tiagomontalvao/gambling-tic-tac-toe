TODO
- Add tqdm progress bars to training and validation
- Add plot loss functions
- Add noise to agent.action() when choosing bids
- Try to change coin action of [0, 1] from total current coins to total initial coins. E.g: 0.5 from 150 coins should represent 50, not 75.
- Add to training loop
    X time
    - patience
- Add asserts
- Add docstrings
- Check TODOs

DOING:
- Create training loop for agent


DONE:
- Change state coins from (..., coins[0], coins[1]) to (..., coins[player], coins[opponent])
- Invalidate invalid movements
- Normalize bid in NN input to [0, 2*initial_value], so that all bids are transformed (bid/(2*initial_value)) and are mapped to the range [0,1).
