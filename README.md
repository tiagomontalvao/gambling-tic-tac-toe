Reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the gambling version of tic-tac-toe.
Description of how it works found here: https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2011/02/25/gambling-tic-tac-toe/
Basically, here are the rules:

1. Each person has a set amount of coins, say $100 each.
2. Before each move, both players place a secret bet out of the coins they have.
3. Then they reveal what amount they have bet.
4. The player with the bigger bet pays his bet amount to the other player.
5. The player that won the bet and paid, can now make a move on the board.
6. Repeat.
