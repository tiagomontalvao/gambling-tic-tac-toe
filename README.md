Reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the gambling version of tic-tac-toe.
Description of how it works found here: https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2011/02/25/gambling-tic-tac-toe/
Basically, here are the rules:

1. Each person has a set amount of coins, say $1000 each.
2. The players then bid for the next move.
3. The loser of the bidding gets to make the first bid on the next move.
4. The game is over when one player has three in a row.
